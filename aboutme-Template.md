    ### Bio
    I'm a font-end dev, drummer, lover of music and beer. Proud dog papa. 🐶🐶

    ### Why you are interested in Programming
    Im interested in programming because I see it as a way to better understand the current world we live in. I love working on any kind of project, from freelance music production sites, to fringe philosophy writer blogs/bio pages, to finance and wild, fun web animation! I see any and all of it as some kind of a learning experience.

    ### Hobbies & Interests
    Some of my interests outside of the dev community include:
    *Home brewing
    *Drumming
    *Taking care of my pup 🐶🐶
    *Cooking
    *Carpentry
